                <img class="hpic" src="images/first_oil.jpg" alt="Oil painting of mountains"> <p>This is the first oil painting I ever completed. Before this, I had no idea I was capable of painting anything that looked remotely realistic, but with the help of Bob Ross, I was able to prove myself wrong. </p>

Rainier, but I ended up making the peak much more jagged than it is in reality. Even so, I still loved the way the reflection in the water turned out. </p>

                <img class="vpictree" src="images/tree_painting.jpg" alt="Abstract painting of tree"> <p>This acrylic painting is my favorite piece I have completed so far. Unlike any of my other paintings, I did not plan it out at all. Instead, I began by painting a gradient, which later I decided to paint the silhouette of a tree over. Soon after, I found myself adding texture and color to the tree, which transformed it into something I am very proud of. </p>
