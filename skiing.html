The majority of the mountain was closed, but we found a way to get to areas of consistently untracked powder. One of the most beautiful days I can remember. </p>

My extremely talented snowboarding friend Dawson was able to get enough speed to flip over my friends. It's amazing how much height you can get with a little help from a jump and a snowmobile. </p>

Riding up the lift together, we were amazed to see this rainbow appear on the ridge. At first we all thought we were imagining it. A Christmas miracle? I'd say so.</p>
