                <img class="hpic" src="images/slo_hike.jpg" alt="Hiking above Cal Poly"> <p>I captured this photo on a hike overlooking Cal Poly just after it had rained for a few days in Slo. It's amazing to watch the hills transform from brown to green here on the Central Coast, it seems to happen in a matter of hours after it rains. </p>

The wind was still, the water was calm, and I couldn't help but stop to admire and capture the reflections created by the surrounding trees. </p>

Every season is full of sunshine, surfers and smiling faces. No wonder it's been called the happiest place in America. </p>

                <img class="vpic" src="images/leavenworth.jpg" alt="Stars at night in Leavenworth, WA"> <p>I'm always working to improve my star photography, but I think this is one of the best night shots I've captured so far. It was taken on January 1st, 2017 in Leavenworth, Washington. The green glow in the background was not visible to the naked eye, and it is still a mystery as to where it came from in this photo. It makes me appreciate it even more. </p>
